# IGC‑SEA Toolkit (Work in Progress)

A lightweight, reproducible toolkit for parsing, analysing, and visualising Inverse Gas Chromatography (IGC) surface energy data.  
This project is currently in active development and will evolve into a clean, documented Python package with optional UI components.

## Aims

- Build a reliable parser for multi‑table CSV exports from IGC instruments  
- Implement core surface energy calculations in a transparent, reproducible way  
- Provide clear visualisations (e.g., γsD, γsAB, acid/base components, isotherms)  
- Offer a simple interface for uploading CSVs and generating graphs  
- Maintain honest documentation of the development process, including AI‑assisted steps  
- Produce a final, user‑friendly tool suitable for early‑career researchers

---

## Current Status

- Early prototypes exist in Jupyter notebooks  
- Core parsing logic under refinement  
- Calculation functions being rewritten for clarity and reproducibility  
- Calculations currently match that given in Cirrus Plus version 1.5
- Full package structure planned but not yet implemented

---

## Timeline

This placeholder will be updated as the project matures.  
A public release is expected once the parser and calculation modules are stable.

## Notes

This project is part of my ongoing journey into computational chemistry, scientific Python, and reproducible research workflows.
