## Full report
- [Download the poster (PDF)]({{ "/assets/pdf/SATRA-POSTER.pdf" | relative_url }})
- [Download the extended report (PDF)]({{ "/assets/pdf/SATRA-REPORT.pdf" | relative_url }})

> **Note:** The extended report was **not required** for the assignment. We chose to produce it (with approval from the module supervisors) to strengthen the scientific rationale behind the poster and provide full references without overloading the layout.

---

## At a glance
- **Outcome:** Designed a scientific poster explaining Satraplatin’s structure, mechanism, and clinical context  
- **Tools:** ChemDraw (structures), BioRender (mechanism figure), AI‑generated title graphic  
- **Skills:** scientific communication, visual design, mechanism mapping, literature synthesis  
- **Result highlight:** clear, text‑light poster supported by a QR‑linked extended report; awarded **70%**

---

## The question
**What makes Satraplatin a viable orally active Pt(IV) prodrug, and how does it differ mechanistically and clinically from cisplatin?**  
Our group explored its design rationale, activation pathway, toxicity profile, and clinical prospects — then communicated this visually through a poster.

---

## Objectives
- Explain why Pt(IV) complexes enable oral delivery  
- Compare Satraplatin’s structure and behaviour to cisplatin  
- Illustrate the intracellular reduction pathway (Pt(IV) → Pt(II) JM‑118)  
- Summarise toxicity differences and clinical trial outcomes  
- Produce a clear, visually driven poster with minimal text  
- Provide deeper context via a QR‑linked extended report  

---

## What we analysed
**Compounds included:** `Cisplatin` · `Satraplatin (JM‑216)` · `JM‑118 (active Pt(II) metabolite)`

---

## Method (short version)
- Reviewed literature on Pt(IV) prodrugs and Satraplatin’s development  
- Used **ChemDraw** to generate skeletal structures  
- Built a **BioRender** mechanism figure showing absorption, reduction, and DNA binding  
- Designed an AI‑assisted **title graphic** for visual identity  
- Structured the poster around **minimal text + strong visuals**  
- Added a **QR code** linking to a full written report for examiners

## Results

### 1) Why Satraplatin works orally
- **Pt(IV) geometry** provides stability in gastric acid  
- **Axial acetato ligands** increase lipophilicity → passive diffusion  
- **Reduced intracellularly** (glutathione/ascorbate) to JM‑118  
- **Avoids premature hydrolysis**, unlike cisplatin  

> **Takeaway:** Satraplatin’s design solves the “IV‑only” limitation of Pt(II) drugs.

---

### 2) Mechanism: how JM‑118 acts
- Reduction converts Pt(IV) → Pt(II)  
- JM‑118 forms **1,2‑intrastrand guanine crosslinks**  
- These adducts are **poorly recognised** by MMR and HMG proteins  
- Helps bypass **cisplatin resistance pathways**

### 3) Toxicity profile (vs cisplatin)

| Feature | Cisplatin | Satraplatin |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Nephrotoxicity | High | Low |
| Neurotoxicity | Frequent | Mild |
| Ototoxicity | Moderate–severe | Minimal |
| GI toxicity | Severe | Mild–moderate |
| Haematologic toxicity | Mild | **Strong, dose‑limiting** |

> **Interpretation:** Satraplatin trades renal/neuro toxicity for haematologic toxicity — a different but manageable profile.

---

## Interpretation (what it means)
**What worked well**
- Clear mechanistic distinction from cisplatin  
- Strong visual communication using diagrams rather than dense text  
- Poster design aligned with best‑practice guidance (minimal text, strong figures)  
- QR code allowed deeper exploration without cluttering the layout  

**What was challenging**
- Balancing scientific depth with poster simplicity  
- Condensing complex Pt(IV) → Pt(II) chemistry into a single figure  
- Ensuring the mechanism diagram remained accurate while visually intuitive  

---

## Improvements (if we repeated it)
- Include a small section on Pt(IV) reduction kinetics  
- Add a toxicity timeline or dose‑response visual  
- Provide a clearer comparison of clinical trial outcomes  
- Expand the QR‑linked report with more mechanistic detail

## What I contributed
- AI‑generated **title artwork**  
- **ChemDraw** structures for cisplatin and Satraplatin  
- **BioRender** mechanism figure (absorption → reduction → DNA binding)  
- Poster layout, colour palette, and visual hierarchy  
- Research and referencing, creating a shared zotero reference manager for the project
- Refinements of final poster content
- Authored the extended report

## What I learned
- How to communicate complex mechanisms visually  
- How to design a poster that prioritises clarity over density  
- How to integrate AI‑assisted tools responsibly in scientific work  
- How to collaborate effectively on scientific communication
