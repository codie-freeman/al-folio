My name is **Codie**, I'm a `BSc Pharmaceutical Chemistry student` with an interest in the full picture of chemistry: **lab work**, **computational tools**, and the **operational/commercial side** that keeps real projects moving.  

I’m currently on placement at <a href='https://www.resolian.com/'>Resolian</a>, working in a `GMP‑compliant` environment. Currently working on a range of sponsor projects and an independent case study on how particle size affects the surface energy of sucrose. It’s given me a clearer sense of how data, documentation, and practical decision‑making fit together in day‑to‑day scientific work, and it’s also pushed me toward the computational side of chemistry.  

I’m planning to take the optional `Python, AI & LLMs for Chemistry` module and I’m aiming for a computational chemistry‑focused final‑year project — building on the scientific Python and reproducible workflow skills I’m developing alongside my placement.

### Background

Before securing my placement in a CRO, I spent several years as a `senior manager` in a busy **£3M‑a‑year hospitality unit**, leading large teams in a fast‑moving, regulated setting. It was a role I genuinely enjoyed. A mix of people management, problem‑solving, and keeping things steady when it all gets a bit chaotic.

I gained hands on experience managing regulatory visits from `Environmental Health Officers`, enforcing **SOPs** as well as lots of business knowledge tracking **KPIs**, managing stock, **SWOT** analysis and completing **business reviews**.

### Outside the Lab

I’m a `STEM Ambassador` and a long‑time `graphic design` hobbyist. I enjoy clean visuals, clear communication, and making technical ideas easier to understand whether thats through outreach or design.
