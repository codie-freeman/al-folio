I’m **Codie Freeman** — a `BSc Pharmaceutical Chemistry student` interested in how science connects to **strategy**, **operations**, and the **business side** of drug development. I’m currently on placement at <a href='https://www.resolian.com/'>Resolian</a>, gaining hands‑on experience in a `GMP‑compliant` environment and learning how data, documentation, and decision‑making come together in real projects.

### Background

Before moving into pharma, I spent several years as a `senior manager` in a busy **£3M‑a‑year hospitality unit**, leading large teams in a fast‑moving, regulated setting. It was a role I genuinely enjoyed - a mix of people management, problem‑solving, and keeping things steady when it all gets a bit chaotic.

### Outside the Lab

I’m a `STEM Ambassador` and a long‑time `graphic design` hobbyist. I enjoy clean visuals, clear communication, and making technical ideas easier to understand — whether through outreach or design.

### Looking Ahead

I’m still exploring where I want to land long‑term. I enjoy wet based chemistry, but I’m also drawn to roles that sit closer to `operations`, and the `commercial` side of the industry. What matters most to me is working somewhere that blends **science, clarity, and impact**.
