The video goes onto touch on the idea of useless knowledge being seen as a waste of capital and that the investment into these ‘useless’ ideas is a waste on the economy.</p> <p>It opens up further discussion ideas into the funding of science as well as the ideas of is any knowledge really useless?</p> <hr> <h2 id="research-article--ai-effort-and-the-job-market">Research Article — AI, Effort, and the Job Market</h2> <h3 id="link-to-paper">Link to Paper</h3> <p><strong>Paper:</strong> <a href="https://jesse-silbert.github.io/website/silbert_jmp.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Silbert (2025) — Job Market Paper</a></p> <p><strong>What caught my attention:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Very relevant to where I am right now</li> <li>Clear distinction between high‑effort vs low‑effort AI use</li> <li>Recruiters struggling to see signal through the noise</li> <li>How this mirrors early‑career uncertainty and the need to show process, not just output</li> </ul> <p>This paper is really one of a kind at the moment, especially with the amount of detail it’s managed to collect over the last four years and the fact it’s still being updated. I’ve only skimmed the 128 pages so far, but even from that, the main takeaway feels clear. It’s not about AI “taking jobs” in the dramatic way people like to frame it but rather about how AI changes the way effort shows up, how it’s judged, and how hard it’s becoming to separate genuine skill from low‑effort noise.</p> <p>What stood out to me is the distinction the author makes between high‑effort and low‑effort AI use. High‑effort use — where someone actually engages with the model, iterates, shapes the output tends to improve performance and is recognised as valuable. Low‑effort use just adds to the pile of generic, surface‑level work that recruiters now have to sift through. And honestly, that feels very relevant to where I am right now. It mirrors the weird tension of trying to build a career in a moment where AI can make your work sharper, but it can also make you invisible if you’re not intentional about how you use it.</p> <hr> <h2 id="article--literally-just-do-things">Article — “Literally Just Do Things”</h2> <h3 id="link-to-article">Link to Article</h3> <p><strong>Article:</strong> <a href="https://erifili.substack.com/p/literally-just-do-things" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Literally Just Do Things — Erifili</a></p> <p><strong>Why it resonated:</strong></p> <ul> <li>A push against perfectionism and over‑optimisation</li> <li>Feeling stuck in an academic/productivity mindset</li> <li>A nudge to start this website and write this post</li> </ul> <p>Though this article is through the lens of business, creative design and influencers I found many parallels in the way I often feel. The statement “I would take advantage of the momentum of inspiration immediately and act on it.” made me think about whether I really jump into opportunities or even seek them out with the confidence I should.</p> <p>I’ve taken this thought and started things this past month I would’ve previously just put to the back of my mind as an idea for the future, things such as starting this website and blog or joining the university backed mentorship programme. And now taking this confident approach into the future, planning to present at least once this year at a industry event and more direct in networking.</p> <hr> <h2 id="album--abbey-road--a-conversation-about-taste">Album — Abbey Road &amp; A Conversation About Taste</h2> <h3 id="album">Album</h3> <p><strong>Album:</strong> <em>Abbey Road</em> — The Beatles</p> <p><strong>A conversation that stuck with me:</strong><br> I was talking to one of my friends about the beatles and they said they <em>just didn’t get them</em>. They didn’t go as far as calling them over rated but its definitely not an opinion I haven’t come across before.</p> <p><strong>My take:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Hard to understand their impact without knowing how limited UK rock was at the time</li> <li>Their songwriting and production were genuinely revolutionary</li> <li>Later albums pushed studio technology and they birthed the concept album</li> <li>They shaped the music landscape we take for granted today</li> </ul> <p><strong>A modern angle:</strong></p> <ul> <li>In an age of instant media, attention‑grabbing content, and algorithmic listening</li> <li>Gen Z’s resurgence of physical media like vinyl and even CDs — feels like a desire for friction and intentionality</li> <li>Abbey Road fits perfectly into that slower, more deliberate way of engaging with music</li> </ul> <p>Abbey road is most definitely one of the most influential albums of the past century, and for good reason. It is absolutely timeless and holds true to this day.</p> <hr> <h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2> <p>Looking back at everything I consumed this week, the common thread was effort and perspective. How it shows up, how it’s valued, and how easy it is to overlook. Documenting it like this feels like a small way of pushing back on the status quo. It forces me to slow down, pay attention, and actually think about what’s shaping my perspective.</p> <hr> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container"> © Copyright 2026 Codie C.
