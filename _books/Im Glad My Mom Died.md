As a fan of biographies as well as growing up watching shows like iCarly, this book was one I wanted to read as soon as I heard it was being released. 

The shock value in the title of the book is not to scoffed at but something that is explored through this books chapters. The insight into child stardom from the perspective of someone who had no interest in the career but did what she thought would make her mum happy. It is a compelling story which is very well written for a first time author.

At times I found it difficult to read with lots of details about her experience with abuse and mental health issues, but at the same time didn't want to put it down. Even for people with no prior knowledge of who Jennette McCurdy is should give it a read as it's, in my eyes at least, a story worth telling.
